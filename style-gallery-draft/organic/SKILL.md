## Instructions
When a user wants to improve their website's Google search ranking, use this skill to guide them through optimizing for the most impactful organic search features. Prioritize the S-Tier tactics, then move to A-Tier, and ensure the user avoids all D-Tier mistakes.

## S-Tier Tactics (Must-Do)
- **Featured Snippets:** Identify common questions your target audience asks and create clear, concise answers in your content (paragraphs, lists, or tables). Structure your content to directly answer these queries to win "position zero."
- **Rich Snippets:** Implement structured data markup (e.g., Schema.org) on your website to enhance your search results with additional information like ratings, reviews, product prices, and event details. This makes your listings more eye-catching and informative.
- **Local Pack:** For businesses with a physical location, create and optimize a Google Business Profile. Ensure your business name, address, phone number (NAP), and website are consistent across the web. Encourage customer reviews to improve your local ranking.

## A-Tier Tactics (Highly Effective)
- **People Also Ask (PAA):** Research the questions that appear in the PAA boxes for your target keywords. Create comprehensive content on your website that answers these questions to capture additional organic traffic.
- **Image Packs:** Optimize your website's images by using descriptive file names, alt text, and compressing them for fast loading. For visual industries, this can drive significant traffic from Google Images.
- **Video Carousels:** Create and optimize videos for YouTube and other platforms. Use relevant keywords in your video titles, descriptions, and tags to appear in video carousels for relevant search queries.

## B-Tier Tactics (Good to Have)
- **Knowledge Panel:** For notable entities (brands, people, organizations), claim and manage your Knowledge Panel to control the information displayed.
- **Sitelinks:** Ensure your website has a clear navigation structure. Google automatically generates sitelinks for sites that are easy to crawl and understand.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (D-Tier)
- **Keyword Stuffing:** Do not load your pages with keywords in an attempt to manipulate rankings. Focus on creating high-quality, user-centric content that naturally incorporates keywords.
- **Ignoring Mobile-First Indexing:** Ensure your website is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience on mobile devices. Google primarily uses the mobile version of your site for indexing and ranking.
- **Neglecting User Experience (UX):** Prioritize a fast-loading website, intuitive navigation, and avoid intrusive pop-ups. A poor user experience leads to high bounce rates and lower rankings.

## Examples

**Example 1: Winning a Featured Snippet**
*User*: "How can I get a featured snippet for my blog post about baking sourdough bread?"
*Claude*: "To get a featured snippet, you should add a concise, step-by-step guide at the beginning of your post. Use a numbered list for the recipe and a short paragraph answering the question 'What is sourdough starter?'. This structure makes it easy for Google to pull your content into a featured snippet."

**Example 2: Optimizing for the Local Pack**
*User*: "My coffee shop isn't showing up in the local map results. What should I do?"
*Claude*: "First, ensure your Google Business Profile is fully filled out and verified. Then, focus on getting more positive customer reviews and make sure your business name, address, and phone number are consistent across all online directories. This will significantly improve your chances of appearing in the local pack."

## Workflow
1.  **Assess the User's Website and Goals:** Start by understanding the user's business, target audience, and current SEO performance.
2.  **Prioritize S-Tier Tactics:** Guide the user to implement optimizations for Featured Snippets, Rich Snippets, and the Local Pack first.
3.  **Implement A-Tier Tactics:** Once the foundation is strong, move on to optimizing for People Also Ask, Image Packs, and Video Carousels.
4.  **Review and Refine:** Continuously monitor performance, analyze results, and refine the strategy based on what's working.
5.  **Educate on D-Tier Mistakes:** Throughout the process, remind the user to avoid common pitfalls like keyword stuffing and neglecting mobile UX.
